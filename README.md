## Assignment: Choosing a team and storing your responses

## Overview:
Our project encompasses a comprehensive user management system, facilitating user registration, login, and submission of responsesâ€”specifically, the selection of a team. These responses are systematically stored within a secure, locally hosted database.

### Languages used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT

#### lIBRARY
1. REACT JS



Challenges faced:
while developing encountered problems relating to the installation and running of json server, we used to run the project sometimes without at first running json server. We learned a lesson on how to run a project without any glitches.

How to install and run the project:
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract it
3. Open the Folder in code editor(VS code)
4. Open the command prompt
5. Move to the project directory (type cd login-form)
6. Install the latest version of the node
7. Type npm run start at server
8. Open another command prompt and type json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
9. This will open a new window in your browser, where you can enter the credentials

How to navigate:
1. At the registration page enter the given inputs and register yourselves as a new user.
2. After the above step, log in using the already entered username and password.
3. This will bring you to the home page.
4. Two options for the user to select a team
5. After selecting a team, the page should dynamically display questions based on the selected team and features.


Thank you.
